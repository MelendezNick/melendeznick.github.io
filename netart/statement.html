  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>The work in this portfolio is meant to give insight in to my life and the ways that I have approached creating art that acts as therapy or meditation on past experiences.These works create a body where each member gives a different point of view for something that has a simple intention. </p>
  <p>Each part of the body is open to interpretation by the viewer. And in the same way the work is meant to create an emotional or empathic connection between the viewer and my experiences. It is my belief that this can create a healing effect for many people who have lived through abuse, suppression, and emotional disconnection from other people.

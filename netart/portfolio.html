    <p>This video symbolizes the passage of external information through the eyes, and the movement of perceived information from within. The information that is being passed in this work is left up to interpretation by the viewer who is watching the
      sitter take in the light and react emotionally. The perceived information coming from the left eye may represent intention from the "sitter", but it is left up to the viewers interpretation.</p>
